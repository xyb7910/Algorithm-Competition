In this Hugo-winning 1991 SF novel, Vernor Vinge gives us a wild new cosmology, a galaxy-spanning "Net of a Million Lies," some finely imagined aliens, and much nail-biting suspense.

Faster-than-light travel remains impossible near Earth, deep in the galaxy's Slow Zone--but physical laws relax in the surrounding Beyond. Outside that again is the Transcend, full of unguessable, godlike "Powers." When human meddling wakes an old Power, the Blight, this spreads like a wildfire mind virus that turns whole civilizations into its unthinking tools. And the half-mythical Countermeasure, if it exists, is lost with two human children on primitive Tines World.

Serious complications follow. One paranoid alien alliance blames humanity for the Blight and launches a genocidal strike. Pham Nuwen, the man who knows about Countermeasure, escapes this ruin in the spacecraft Out of Band--heading for more violence and treachery, with 500 warships soon in hot pursuit. On his destination world, the fascinating Tines are intelligent only in combination: named "individuals" are small packs of the doglike aliens. Primitive doesn't mean stupid, and opposed Tine leaders wheedle the young castaways for information about guns and radios. Low-tech war looms, with elaborately nested betrayals and schemes to seize Out of Band if it ever arrives. The tension becomes extreme... while half the Beyond debates the issues on galactic Usenet.

Vinge's climax is suitably mindboggling. This epic combines the flash and dazzle of old-style space opera with modern, polished thoughtfulness. Pham Nuwen also appears in the nifty prequel set 30,000 years earlier, A Deepness in the Sky. Both recommended. --David Langford, Amazon.co.uk

From Publishers Weekly
It has been six years since Vinge's last book ( Marooned in Realtime ), but the wait proves worthwhile in this stimulating tale filled with ideas, action and likable, believable characters, both alien and human. Vinge presents a galaxy divided into Zones--regions where different physical constraints allow very different technological and mental possibilities. Earth remains in the "Slowness" zone, where nothing can travel faster than light and minds are fairly limited. The action of the book is in the "Beyond," where translight travel and other marvels exist, and humans are one of many intelligent species. One human colony has been experimenting with ancient technology in order to find a path to the "Transcend," where intelligence and power are so great as to seem godlike. Instead they release the Blight, an evil power, from a billion-year captivity. As the Blight begins to spread, a few humans flee with a secret that might destroy it, but they are stranded in a primitive low-tech world barely in the Beyond. While the Blight destroys whole races and star systems, a team of two humans and two aliens races to rescue the others, pursued by the Blight's agents and other enemies. With uninterrupted pacing, suspense without contrivance, and deftly drawn aliens who can be pleasantly comical without becoming cute, Vinge offers heart-pounding, mind-expanding science fiction at its best.

Some like it, some hate it. Regardless, read it., November 16, 1997
Reviewer:	Walter Flaschka (Oxford, MS USA) - See all my reviews
(REAL NAME)   
Most of us are probably aware of how, as you read more and more science fiction, your stack of 'extremely good' books stays mostly level while the stack of 'acceptable' books outgrows your bookshelf. You start to appreciate the writers who have done their duty to science fiction by studying the Drexlers, the Minskys and Feynmans -- the scientists whose sheer extrapolative powers really push the borders of imagination.

Vinge is one of those hardworking writers. He is the author of the hard-to-find "True names and other dangers..." which means you can credit him for adding several of the future- or tech-based memes most of us take for granted today.

The ratings for this book waver between 6-10, with a '2' thrown in by some poor fellow. Don't worry about Vernor Vinge's grammatical capabilities -- he writes a mean sentence, and some of the best technical descriptions I've ever read. For a genre which pedestalizes Asimov, who could hardly string 6 words together coherently (guess he was moving too fast), some people are MIGHTY picky!

Also, you won't find the "-oid" syndrome which you get with Bujold, for example, where contemporary items are made to sound science-fictiony just by giving them a new name. You won't read sentences like "He grabbed his key-oids and jumped in his car-oid..."

Vinge's science is deep, and the ramifications of everything from the 'slow zone' to the 'unthinking deeps' to the 'agrav fabric docks' to the hi-tech of the beyond, to the cute extrapolation of an Internet of galactic scope, to the effect of radio upon the Tines (a sophont race), to the matter-of-fact acceptance of racial senescence... all of these things are well thought out and brilliantly presented. You will see many of Vinge's concepts become commonplace in science fiction, and you'll be able to say you saw it here first. :)

Vinge is a scientist/mathmetician, after all, and he seems constitutionally unable to write the soft-science glop which is taking over science fiction. His science fiction is as hard as diamond, and the only bad side effect is that the people you read between the 'good ones' will seem much more inept and unimaginative.

Don't worry about Vinge's characterizations... they're strong and capable (especially those of the skroderiders (plants) and the tines (pack intelligences)). You'll be fascinated by his treatment of alien mentalities... and if you aren't, well, luckily science fiction isn't about characterization anyways.

If you want character, read a novel, which is the genre of the character. If you want science fiction, you could do MUCH worse than come here... you'll be adding a nice thick book to your small stack of 'extremely good' books.

Slow Going, But Worth Reading Anyway, December 8, 2000
Reviewer:	Amanda M. Hayes (Indianapolis, IN) - See all my reviews
(REAL NAME)   
This was a very silly book for the professor of my Intro to Sci-Fi class to assign at the end of the semester. Not because of the page-count, as relatively large as that is; not because it's too weighty or complex to understand, either, since it really isn't. However, it *is* a book that moves somewhat slowly--and which will not, frankly speaking, keep you turning pages late into the night out of any fervent desire to see what happens next.

Despite this, I'd still highly recommend it for the reader who doesn't mind possibly being in for a long haul. The concepts introduced in _Fire Upon the Deep_ are fascinating: Zones of Thought, Skroderiders, Powers, Transcendence--and particularly the Known Net, an Internet-like contrivance which links a good part of the galaxy together. Balanced against these science fictional elements is the more fantastic setting of Tines' World, a medieval land inhabited by dog-like creatures who communicate through telepathy and have an intriguing method of genetic engineering. Whether you're a fan of science fiction, fantasy, or just a good tale, there's something here for you. Unfortunately, the rushed and anti-climactic ending does detract from what would otherwise be an excellent story.

Know what to expect before you buy this book: interesting--and fresh!--ideas, wonderfully vivid characters, a bit of humor, a bit of horror, technological exposition, and a good, solid plot. Don't read this if you're out for something quick and light, and be prepared to put it down now and then, maybe even picking something else to read before you finish. This isn't a fast or easy novel to get through... but the virtues of it make it worthwhile to endure this vice.

Liked the story despite all the high tech speak, September 23, 2006
Reviewer:	greybon (USA) - See all my reviews
My reading choices in sci-fi have typically been X-files related. I've read William Gibson's Virtual Light and Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game, but beyond that? I really don't know that I've read others. This is why I believe it took me so long to read Vernor Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep. I'd read a little, then put it down. A few weeks later, I'd pick it up and read a little more. However, I plowed through the last 200 pages or so.

This is a very complex story, full of captivating characters in richly detailed lands. Jefri and Johanna Olsndot are children stranded on a medieval planet, where the inhabitants are canine creatures that exist in pack forms. The crew (Ravna, Pham, Blueshell, Greenstalk) of a ship named the OOB, races to save them and to retrieve an artifact that just may save the world.

I'll admit, this book is a slow read initially. The first third of it tripped me up with all the high tech space speak. Plus, the author includes many Internet style messages that are pretty much reading email across the universe. These messages are technical soup. Toward the end I found myself just skipping over them.

Once I got past that initial space speak section and into the medieval world (and read far enough to actually understand that the inhabitants were pack creatures) I found myself entranced by this world. I loved seeing the children interact with these creatures. The author did an excellent job with creating a wide variety of personalities, yet blending them all nicely into the story.

Any time the story flipped back to space I found it lagging. Mostly because all the geek speak was over my head. I followed some of it with a struggle between great Powers. And I liked Blueshell and Greenstalk, who are basically plants on wheels and have limited short term memory. That made for some amusing scenes. But overall, the scenes that happened in the skies, weren't as interesting to me as what was going on down below.

Yet, even with that, I loved this story. I can easily see myself skimming through it just to read about this canine pack world again. The culture is that fascinating. Packs of dog like beings who live in a medieval society. They use their mouths to grasp tools just as they do their paws. And they can't get too close to each other or the mind noise that radiates from each pack entity will confuse them. Plus there are two sides at war, so the story is ripe with spies and the race for technological advances to defeat the enemy. All in all, very cool! I'll just skip over all the space talk. :P

Don't get it, don't like it, September 5, 2006
Reviewer:	MEA (Davis, CA) - See all my reviews
I'm sure many won't like my review, but I just don't get the point of this book. I'm around page 70 (as another reviewer was) and I'm desperate to move on to another book. The writing is inconsistent in voice, the author fails to ground the reader in the book's world. For example, it takes the author forever and a day to make it clear that the dog-like creatures travel in packs and that they think as a unit, even then I have questions, for example, do any of the members have independent thought, what is their history, etc. Granted the author can't give up all information up front, but at least make us like the characters. None of the characters are sympathetic...if any of them died, I wouldn't care. And frankly, I wish I'd understood better that the main storyline centered around telepathy and thoughts - I don't find that subject matter believable. I bought this book because it was rated highly on Amazon's science fiction book list. Next time I'll do better research.

	Excellent, Thought Provoking, August 30, 2006
Reviewer:	James D. Michels "jdmichels" (Paris France) - See all my reviews
(REAL NAME)   
Excellent, Thought Provoking

I don't have time to write an in depth review, but this book deserved a recommendation, so I will be direct and brief.

The base premises such as the "slow zone" that make this book different are excellent. The writing style is good, characterization and descriptions are good. The only possible downside to this book is an assumption by the author that the reader is capable of doing a little mental work while reading. This is not your passive, MTV story. There are gaps and leaps that you will have to work at. I find that a valuable part of the read.

I expect that many of the people that reviewed this book poorly just don't have the mental guns to keep up with the story. Something simple like Eragon would be more appropriate for them.

This is classic, hard Sci-Fi well done.

It is not as great or sweeping as Dune, not as spectacular as Stranger in a Strange Land, but it is as good as Ring World.

Highly Recommended.

	Prescient, intriguing, stands up to a re-read (and a re-re-read), August 11, 2006
Reviewer:	antenna (ex-UK now US) - See all my reviews
I first read this book in the late 90s. Since then, I have re-read it twice. Each time, I enjoyed it. The ideas are original and thought-provoking, the writing competent, the plotting intricate and well-executed, and the characterization multidimensional. Even 13 years after publication, it does not feel dated (unlike so much science fiction). I liked the way the the author constantly but gently pokes at the reader's preconceptions. I'm looking forward to reading it again in a few years!
