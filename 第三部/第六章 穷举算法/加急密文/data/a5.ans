                o requests to circumvent ordinary review and approval procedures.

          * 7.2 Public Communications
            The Company places a high value on its credibility and reputation. What is written or said about the Company in the news media and investment community directly impacts its reputation, positively or negatively. The Company's policy is to provide timely, accurate and complete information in response to public requests (media, analysts, etc.), consistent with its obligations to maintain the confidentiality of competitive and proprietary information and to prevent selective disclosure of market-sensitive financial data.
                o Compliance with Regulation FD and Communications with Investment Community The Company is strongly encouraged to follow the requirements of Regulation FD ("Fair Disclosure") promulgated under the U.S. securities laws in the same manner as if it were a U.S. domestic reporting company. Regulation FD provides that, when a company discloses material, non-public information about the company to securities market professionals or shareholders (where it is reasonably foreseeable that the shareholders will trade on the information), that company must also instantaneously disclose the information to the public. "Securities market professionals" generally include analysts, institutional investors and other investment advisors.

                  Only the Investor Relations Manager is authorized to disclose information about the Company in response to requests from securities market professionals or shareholders. No Employee shall, without first obtaining explicit approval from the Investor Relations Manager, communicate directly with the investment community (including but not limited to shareholders, analysts, fund managers or potential investors) any information regarding the Company, regardless whether such information has been disclosed publicly or not. If an Employee receives a request for information from any securities market professionals or shareholders, he or she should promptly contact the Investor Relations Manager to coordinate a response to such request.

                o Communications with Media
                  No Employee shall communicate with any media, publicly or privately, without first consulting with the Company's personnel responsible for releasing information. In the event any issue arises that may emerge as a potential public relations emergency, such as customer's complaints written on a public forum, Employees shall immediately report such incident to the personnel responsible for releasing information. If any member of the media asks for information about the Company or makes any other requests, Employees shall refer their inquiries or requests to the Company's Investor Relations Manager. For more detailed provisions regarding relationships with the media, Employees shall refer to Rules for External Communications by Senior Management and Other Employees to ensure that every Employee will act in accordance with the prescribed conduct rules.

          * 8.1 Procurement of Goods and Services We guarantee fair dealings with our suppliers and we choose our suppliers through a fair evaluation of competitive bids. No Employee shall discriminate against or deceive a supplier. The decision to choose a particular supplier shall be made by reference to the price, service, quality and reputation of the supplier as considered in the context of the Company's long-term commercial interests.

            All Employees should endeavor to deal fairly and honestly with the Company's suppliers. No Employee shall attempt to unduly influence the process of choosing a supplier or treat any particular supplier on a preferential basis that would damage the supplier assessment and selection process. Employees should not accept or solicit any personal gains from any supplier that might compromise, or appear to compromise, their objective assessment of the supplier. Employees shall hold the pricing or product information provided by the supplier or potential supplier in confidence. Execution of a supply agreement must be properly approved.

          * 8.2 Gifts and Entertainment
            The Company's business is founded on the principle of "fair transaction." Therefore, no Employee may receive kickbacks, bribe others, or secretly receive commissions or any other personal benefits. Appropriate business gifts and entertainment are welcome courtesies, however, giving or receiving gifts or entertainment is deemed by the Company as tending to impose an improper influence on a person.

            No Employee or his/her family members shall receive gifts, services, touring arrangements and entertainment that may affect his/her judgment in fulfilling his/her obligations to the Company.

            Each Employee must report to his/her departmental head any gifts offered and seek the departmental head's approval prior to receiving such gifts.

Employees may only accept gifts that do not carry any commercial value, such as a notepad or calendar. Employees should not accept gifts under the following circumstances if such gifts:
                o may result in any unnecessary or unwanted publicity of the Company;
                o may influence the Company or place the Company in a dilemma;
                o may obligate the recipient in any way; or
                o are in the form of cash or cash equivalents.
