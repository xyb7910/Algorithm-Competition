Free Software/Open Source Software :

html,http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html,

GPL :

The General Public License is a Free Software license.
For further details see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html.

2.What licensing model does Mandriva Linux follow?

All code developed and distributed by Mandriva is released under the General Public License or equivalent. Mandriva Download Edition products only include software covered by a Free Software/Open Source license. Mandriva Commercial products include proprietary third-party software products, which contain their own licensing models.

3.What is the difference between the Download Products License and the Commercial Products License?

Both products are ruled by Open Source licenses. The difference is not the license of our products, but the licenses of third party software contained in the commercial distributions. Download Products only include components licensed under a Free Software/Open Source License. Commercial Products may also include software add-ons which are covered by a proprietary license which often prevents free copying and redistribution of the product.

4.Do third party software products have their own licensing models?

Yes. Third party software included in our Commercial products may be demonstration versions (e.g. Kaspersky, Crossover Office...), time limited versions, or versions that require a key to be activated, or freeware which retain a proprietary license. Please consult the appropriate instructions in each software package for complete licensing terms.

5.What is the functional difference between the Download Products and the Commercial Products, licenses aside?

/a Mandriva Commercial products include additional features and functions that improve operability with certain network adapters and graphic cards (such as proprietary drivers for N/aDIA(r) NForce and ATI (tm)). Furthermore, Mandrivasoft Commercial products often include support options (such as Mandriva Expert), documentation, and premium online services such as Mandriva Club and Mandrivaonline. Each commercial product is developed for a specific use to take advantage of superior system integration, extended life cycles, and/or maintenance programs.

6.Can I distribute Download Products?

/a Yes, it is permissible to copy and distribute Download products. In any case, the following notice must appear clearly and distinctively: This product is the Mandriva Linux Distribution known as ? Mandrivalinux Download Edition ? or "Mandriva Linux Move Download Edition" (or any other freely downloadable Mandriva product name). Commercial products such as "Mandriva Linux Powerpack Edition" (or "Mandrivalinux Move" or other derivative) include more features than the Download Edition such as commercial add-ons and third-party software. Commercial products also provide documentation and access to Mandriva services such as support. Download editions may be freely downloaded via the Internet at the following location:

7.Can I distribute Commercial Products for free?

No. Certain third party software, not governed by a free software license, is bundled with commercial products. Additionally, you may not use the Mandriva name, trademarks and logos (which is our business responsibility to protect), without prior agreement.

8.I am a Mandriva Club Member. Can I distribute "Power Pack", "Power Pack+", "Mandriva Linux Move", "AMD64 Edition" or "Power Pack DVD Edition" Mandrivalinux versions that I downloaded as a Member of Mandriva Club?

No. These products contain third party software which are covered by proprietary licenses and are thus not redistributable. Additionally, these are premium products offered to Club members as part of their subscription. Thus, they are not intended to be freely distributed. However, if you wish to become a Mandriva distributor, we would gladly welcome you as a Mandrivasoft Partner and establish a win/win agreement. See our Partner Page.

9.Can I make modifications to Mandriva Linux Products?

Yes. User contributed modifications aimed at improving software is the essence of Free Software. These modifications must retain the same Free Software license that you were granted (please refer to the GPL text for further details: www.gnu.org) whenever you distribute the resulting product.

10.Can I distribute the modifications I performed on the Download Products of Mandriva Linux?

You may not redistribute a modified version of Mandriva Download products unless all registered trademarks, brands, names and logos referring to Mandrivasoft are removed. This includes, for instance, the use of the word "Mandriva Linux", "Mandriva", the Mandriva Linux and Mandrivasoft logos. This is required to protect Mandrakesoft's intellectual property rights and to avoid creating confusion for our clients. However, if you wish to become a Mandrakesoft distributor, we would gladly welcome you as a Mandrakesoft Partner and establish a win/win agreement. See our Partner Page.

11.Can I distribute the modifications I performed on the commercial versions of Mandriva Linux without asking Mandriva?

Yes, but only if you remove all software that is not covered by a Free Software license. Also, all registered trademarks, brands, names and logos related to Mandriva must be removed. If you do not comply with these terms, you are not allowed to distribute the modifications as this would constitute an infringement of the intellectual property rights owned by each software owner. Also, you may not call this product "Mandriva Linux" or any other name related to Mandriva so our clients will not be confused by projects that we are not associated with.

12.I run e-commerce activities (i.e., I sell on eBay, on some other commercial site or on my own website); can I distribute a Mandriva product (including the Download) in the absence of an agreement?

You can only distribute the download and only if you comply with the rules exposed in questions 6 and question 8.

Yes, of course: you just need to sign an agreement with Mandriva to use our trademarks and logos. In absence of such an agreement, you would have to remove our name and brands from your product.
